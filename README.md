### Questions

### Section A: Program Specification
### QUESTIONS 1 of 4:
### Ingredient Adjuster
#### A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:
#### • 1.5 cups of sugar
#### • 1 cup of butter
####  • 2.75 cups of flour
The recipe produces 48 cookies with this amount of the ingredients. Write a program that asks 
the user how many cookies he or she wants to make, and then displays the number of cups of 
each ingredient needed for the specified number of cookies.

### QUESTIONS 2 of 4:
#### Population
#### Write a program that predicts the approximate size of a population of organisms. The 
application should allow the user to enter the starting number of organisms, the average daily 
population increase (as a percentage), and the number of days the organisms will be left to 
multiply. 
#### For example, assume the user enters the following values:
#### Starting number of organisms: 2
#### Average daily increase: 30%
#### Number of days to multiply: 10
#### The program should display the following table of data:
#### Day Approximate Population
#### 1 2
#### 2 2.6
#### 3 3.38
#### 4 4.394
#### 5 5.7122
#### 6 7.42586
#### 7 9.653619
#### 8 12.5497
#### 9 16.31462
#### 10 21.209

### QUESTIONS 3 of 4:

#### Rainfall Statistics
#### Design and write a program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of 12 months into 
a list. The program should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, the average 
monthly rainfall, and the months with the highest and lowest amounts


### QUESTIONS 4 of 4:
#### Falling Distance
 When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine 
the distance the object falls in a specific time period:
#### The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the 
#### amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.

Write a function named falling_distance that accepts an object’s falling time (in seconds) as 
an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen 
during that time interval. Write a program that calls the function in a loop that passes the 
values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.
